            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p>I grew up in Chicago with two younger brothers.  I went to college in
            California at Caltech.  While there I studied Astrophysics and learned
            how to program.  I moved to Seattle with my fiance a year and a half ago.</p>
            <h3>My Programming History</h3>
            <p>I first learned to program while at college.  The first language that 
            I learned was Python, but since then I have also learned C, C++, Java, 
            Scheme, and JavaScript.  While in college, I did research in astrophysics 
            that taught me a lot about coding.  I use machine learning algorithms to 
            classify types of stars.  After graduating from college, I started 
            working for Coding with Kids where I learned even more about programming.</p>
            <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
            <p>When I am not programming or teaching, I like spending time with my 
            fiance.  We like exploring Seattle and going to theater productions.  
            I also enjoy cooking, dancing, and reading.</p>
